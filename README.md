60 Days of Learning Web Design


Day 3:
======
Today I wanted to do two things: I wanted to work on NOT putting formatting
in the HTML directly and I wanted to add my first Javascript function. I am
excited to say that Day 3 was a success!! I made a simple page that had two
sections and took an input, added a button listener, and output the content
of the text box to a second label. I'd estimate that it took a little under
two hours to finish and write up. What helped today was that I already drew
the initial outline for what I wanted to build and didn't have to do any of 
the design work before just going straight to coding! In the midst of it, I 
also got an idea for a project for tomorrow, which I'll sketch out tonight. 

I learned that github doesn't work quite right on my OneDrive (which really 
wasn't a surprise) and moved my local repository back onto my local machine
to solve an error I was getting where I had to git add each file I tried to
check in, even though they were already being tracked. Unfortunately, I did
this after I finished most of the page for today and didn't get a chance to
see if moving the repo from OneDrive helped. I also realized why there is a
tabs vs. spaces developer debate and I'll be seeing which I end up having a
preference for as I write more code. I suspect it will be the tabs winning.
