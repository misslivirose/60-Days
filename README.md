60 Days of Learning Web Design

Day 14:
=======
Isn't it suprising when the days you don't expect to be productive ones end
up teaching you all sorts of things? Today, I got home late and didn't feel
like I was going to be able to do much: and if you check out the site I did
today, it won't necessarily look like it - I was playing more around with a
visual style. Yesterday, I didn't actually do any new coding, but I did add
a site for the day, and the mental break helped me make several connections
today that I hadn't previously put together. I know what I'm doing tomorrow
as a result, and it may not be something pretty, but having the right tools
at my disposal should greatly enhance what I'm able to pull together daily.

Day 11:
=======
Days 9 and 10 I played around a little bit more with basic animations and I
was able to get a feel for how keyframes work. Yesterday's project was a VT
portfolio that played around with some CSS customizations, and today I made
a page that almost looks like the start of something legitimate! I wanted a
page that I could do an icon for, and picked a candy theme. I learned about
using Google for getting customized fonts, worked on color coordination and
shadowing/highlighting, and practiced some types of adjustment for the page
to lay out *kind of* correctly when I adjusted the window size! I got a bit
more knowledge about using git and updated my gh-pages branch. Day 11 has a
little bit more detail about what I was aiming for on the page itself, plus
an easter egg that I hid in the form of a hyperlink! (And a tooltip shows!)

Day 8:
======
I didn't write anything the past two days because there wasn't much to show
for those two days. Saturday, I was busy taking the GRE and only did a tiny
happy birthday image. Most of it was done in Inkscape and was just shown as
an image. Yesterday, I did a static page that showed off images of the view
in Belhaven and pictures of my parent's house. I learned how to use Inspect
Element feature in Chrome to debug, which was great for fixing layouts. The
site that I made today was something with animations! I originally was only
going to make a small back and forth animation, but ended up in Inkscape to
make buttons when I finished quickly. Today was exciting, because I finally
put everything together and have started figuring out how it all fits in to
the different places. I also got a new idea for a game to build - I may try
building a slightly bigger project after doing a couple of weeks of this!!!


Day 5:
======
It's been an entirely exhausting week, so today's program was a simple page
that let you perform three math operations on two numbers. I wanted to work 
on a program with a few more functions, and didn't realize until today that 
I've had to go back to really basic programming problems. It's like being a
new computer science student over again, but with a bit more confidence and 
with my own twist to it. Today, I learned about the drop down menu and made
a script with more than one function in it. I'm planning on getting several
more small pages in, and then perhaps do my first attempt at something more
interesting - I've got an idea that I'm musing about using the FCC comments
that were released about net neutrality. First, I have a few other things I
need to learn to do something like that. I'll have more time tomorrow since
it's a weekend, so maybe I'll try to do something more complex and host it.

Day 4:
======
I got the initial code done pretty quickly for this time around, but I made
an effort to do a slightly better job with my UI. I am still having a weird
issue with git where I have to re-add the file each time I commit. Today, I
made a simple website that counts down the days until my parents visit, but
I guess that probably won't still be doing the right thing when the 60 days
are up, since my algorithm isn't the cleanest. I tried to use JQuery to get
the window size to make my panels adjust properly, but realized after a few
attempts that I didn't really need to use that at all, I just needed to use
width=% for each of the three columns. I'm a little bit frustrated with how
lacking my designs are, but I think that as I progress I'll be a little bit
better about utilizing the tools and finding the most efficient ways to get
stuff done. For tomorrow, I will be doing a simple site to calculate simple
mathematics problems (+, -, *, /). Partially inspired by the GRE... 2 days.


Day 3:
======
Today I wanted to do two things: I wanted to work on NOT putting formatting
in the HTML directly and I wanted to add my first Javascript function. I am
excited to say that Day 3 was a success!! I made a simple page that had two
sections and took an input, added a button listener, and output the content
of the text box to a second label. I'd estimate that it took a little under
two hours to finish and write up. What helped today was that I already drew
the initial outline for what I wanted to build and didn't have to do any of 
the design work before just going straight to coding! In the midst of it, I 
also got an idea for a project for tomorrow, which I'll sketch out tonight. 

I learned that github doesn't work quite right on my OneDrive (which really 
wasn't a surprise) and moved my local repository back onto my local machine
to solve an error I was getting where I had to git add each file I tried to
check in, even though they were already being tracked. Unfortunately, I did
this after I finished most of the page for today and didn't get a chance to
see if moving the repo from OneDrive helped. I also realized why there is a
tabs vs. spaces developer debate and I'll be seeing which I end up having a
preference for as I write more code. I suspect it will be the tabs winning.
