    <h1> Design </h1>
    <p class = "designtext"> Software should be functional, beautiful, and usable. In today's technology-centric world, it is
      increasingly important that applications and services are designed to supplement the user's
      real-world experiences and supply them with a worry-free way to use the products they love. </p>
      <div id = "icons">
        <br>
        <h2 class = "sectionheaders"> Icons </h2>
        <img class = "iconclip" src = "Love Bug.png">
        <img class = "iconclip" src = "CandyIcon.png">
        <img class = "iconclip" src = "Lipstick.png">
        <p class = "designtext"> Your application's icon is the front door to your product - it is the essence of your service packaged
          neatly into a beautiful representation of your brand and hints at the experiences your users will quickly learn to love and trust.
          Bright colors, clean lines, and subtle shadows evoke a sense of fun and simplicity. </p>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div>
          <h2 class = "sectionheaders"> Apps </h2>
          <p class = "designtext"> Applications should be intuitive and instinctive. It is vital that each app is respectful of
          the platform it runs on, presenting the user with an experience that is both delightful and uniquely familiar. </p>

          <p class = "designtext"> In summer of 2013, I joined Microsoft as a user experience program manager on the Remote Desktop team in
          Mountain View, California, where I worked closely with visual designers and researchers to identify usability issues
          and utilized agile development techniques to decrease the amount of time needed to prototype UI designs. I led the first
          round of user interface sketching for the Remote Desktop appliation on Windows Phone, and have since worked closely with
          other team members to continue iterating on interaction and visual design updates.</p>
      </div>

  <!--  The code div -->
  <div id = "dev_container">
    <h1> Development </h1>
    <p class = "designtext"> I graduated with my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science in May, 2013 from Virginia Tech with a focus in software
      design and requirements engineering. While at Tech (go Hokies!) I studied programming fundamentals in computer organization, systems-level
      development, object-oriented programming, language structuring, and specification standards. </p>
    <p class = "designtext"> In addition to my structured coursework, I developed curricula for Windows 8 Modern development for Microsoft Surface
      in conjunction with the Virginia Tech Mobile Software Engineering Lab as an undergraduate research project, during which I built 8 applications
      and wrote their associated tutorials for various Windows 8 apps. In addition to technical research, I also had a chance to work in a
      cross-disciplinary communications course that aimed to analyze the effects of virtual environments on society by preparing and submitting
      a research proposal to the Virginia Tech IRB.
