		<h1> Livi Erickson </h1>
		<h2> College of Engineering </h2>
		<p> I earned my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science from Virginia Tech in May of 2013. During my
		time at Tech, I was an active member of the Society of Women Engineers and am a sister of the engineering
		sorority Alpha Omega Epsilon. I participated in the first-year Women in Engineering community housing at
		Virginia Tech and served as a mentor with the Center for the Enhancement of Engineering Diversity as well
		as for the Computer Science department.</p>

		<p> After graduation, I joined Microsoft as a Program Manager in user experience for the Remote Desktop team
			in Mountain View, California, where I have been working UI design and development for the iOS, Android, 
			Windows Phone, and Mac RDP clients. </p>
